<h1>The Best Movie According to Punit</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Hacked</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, ‘Hacked’ feels like an exposé of some sorts at the beginning but gradually, one learns that it is just
    a half-baked attempt. Do not let this film ‘hack’ away your weekend!</p>
<h3>Tik Tik Tik</h3>
<p> Tipped as a first-of-its-kind space film from the country, Tik Tik Tik begins when the Defense Space Division team
    (DSD), which has Mahendran (Jayaprakash) at its helm, finding that an asteroid is on its way to earth. It is
    expected to hit the planet in seven days, putting the lives of four crore people in danger. They further learn that
    a heavy missile should be used to destroy the asteroid.</p>
<h3>KGF Chapter :- 1 & 2 </h3>
<p>instead of working more with him, the second half of the screenplay meanders in about 3 directions all at once.
    Raveena Tandon appears as a manic politician, newly sworn in as PM, too quick to declare war on Burma just to prove
    a point to…Pakistan? No. Russia? No. The USA? No.</p>
